Tasky is react-based web application for storing your daily tasks (just tried to make project based on react after learning react)


for using this follow below steps
1 first go to tasky folder 
2 then go to myapp folder
3 open terminal in this myapp folder
4 write commands (npm start)
5 open another terminal for this myapp folder
6 write commands (npx json-server --watch data/data.json  port 8000)
